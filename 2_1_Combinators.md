**Definition**

- pure function (no side effects / no reliance on variables outside scope / same in produces same out) that doesn't have any free variables (variables within scope of the function that aren't explicitely passed in as arguments)
- combinators are a means to an end and not a merit in itself
- Don't use if it makes code more complex or more difficult to read
